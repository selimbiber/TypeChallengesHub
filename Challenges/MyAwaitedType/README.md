# My Awaited Type

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyAwaited` type that extracts the type contained within a `Promise`. This type should allow you to obtain the type of the value that a `Promise` resolves to, even if the `Promise` is nested.

This challenge will help you deepen your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with `Promise` types and type inference. Good luck!

### Example

```ts
type ExamplePromise = Promise<string>;

type Result = MyAwaited<ExamplePromise>; // Result should be string
```

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyAwaited`.
- [x] This type should take a `Promise` type and extract its resolved type.
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's conditional types.

### Hints

- You can use TypeScript's `infer` keyword within a conditional type to capture the resolved type of the `Promise`.
- Consider how to handle nested `Promise` types.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your solution works for various `Promise` types, including those that resolve to other `Promise` types.
- Test your `MyAwaited` type with different `Promise` signatures to verify its correctness.

### Example Test Cases

```ts
type Test1 = MyAwaited<Promise<number>>; // Test1 should be number
type Test2 = MyAwaited<Promise<void>>; // Test2 should be void
type Test3 = MyAwaited<Promise<Promise<string>>>; // Test3 should be string
type Test4 = MyAwaited<Promise<{ name: string }>>; // Test4 should be { name: string }
```
