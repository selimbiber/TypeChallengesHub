# MyChainable

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyChainable` type that allows for method chaining to set multiple properties on an object. This type should provide methods to set a name and an age, and a method to build the final object. The goal is to enhance your understanding of TypeScript's interfaces and method chaining patterns.

### Tasks

- [x] Create an interface called `MyChainable`.
- [x] This interface should include methods to set a name and an age, returning `this` for method chaining.
- [x] Implement a method to build and return the final object containing the name and age.

### Hints

- Use the `this` type in the method signatures to enable method chaining.
- Ensure that the `build` method returns an object with the specified properties.

### Additional Notes

- Test your `MyChainable` interface with a class implementation to verify its functionality.
- Consider edge cases, such as setting properties in different orders.

### Example Test Cases

```typescript
const person = new PersonBuilder().setName("Ali").setAge(30).build();

console.log(person); // Output: { name: 'Ali', age: 30 }
```
