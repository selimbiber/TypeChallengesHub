# My Exclude

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyExclude` type that excludes certain types from a given union type. This type should allow you to filter out specific types from a union, resulting in a new union type that contains only the types that are not excluded.

This challenge will help you deepen your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with conditional types and type manipulation. Good luck!

### Example

```ts
type ExampleUnion = string | number | boolean;

type Result = MyExclude<ExampleUnion, number>; // Result should be string | boolean
```

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyExclude`.
- [x] This type should take two type parameters: `T` (the union type) and `U` (the type to exclude).
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's conditional types.

### Hints

- You can use TypeScript's conditional types to check if a type `T` extends type `U`.
- Use the `never` type to filter out the types that should be excluded.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your solution works for various union types and exclusion scenarios.
- Test your `MyExclude` type with different union types to verify its correctness.

### Example Test Cases

```ts
type Test1 = MyExclude<string | number | boolean, number>; // Test1 should be string | boolean
type Test2 = MyExclude<1 | 2 | 3 | 4, 2 | 3>; // Test2 should be 1 | 4
type Test3 = MyExclude<"a" | "b" | "c", "b">; // Test3 should be "a" | "c"
```
