# My NonNullable

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyNonNullable` type that excludes `null` and `undefined` values from a given type. This type should allow you to filter out these specific values, resulting in a new type that contains only the non-nullable types.

This challenge will help you deepen your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with conditional types and type manipulation. Good luck!

### Example

```ts
type ExampleType = string | number | null | undefined;

type Result = MyNonNullable<ExampleType>; // Result should be string | number
```

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyNonNullable`.
- [x] This type should take one type parameter: `T` (the type to filter).
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's conditional types.

### Hints

- You can use TypeScript's conditional types to check if a type `T` extends `null` or `undefined`.
- Use the `never` type to filter out the types that should be excluded.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your solution works for various types and scenarios involving `null` and `undefined`.
- Test your `MyNonNullable` type with different types to verify its correctness.

### Example Test Cases

```ts
type Test1 = MyNonNullable<string | number | null | undefined>; // Test1 should be string | number
type Test2 = MyNonNullable<null | undefined | boolean>; // Test2 should be boolean
type Test3 = MyNonNullable<"a" | null | "b" | undefined>; // Test3 should be "a" | "b"
```
