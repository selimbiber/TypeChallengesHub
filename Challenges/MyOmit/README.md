# MyOmit

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyOmit` type that excludes specific keys from a given object type. This type should allow you to define a new object type that contains all the properties of the original type except for the ones specified to be omitted.

This challenge will help you enhance your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with mapped types and utility types. Good luck!

### Example

```typescript
type MyOmit<T, K extends keyof any> = Pick<T, Exclude<keyof T, K>>;
```

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyOmit`.
- [x] This type should take two type parameters: `T` (the object type) and `K` (the keys to omit).
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's utility types like `Pick` and `Exclude`.

### Hints

- Use `keyof` to get the keys of the object type `T`.
- Use `Exclude` to filter out the keys specified in `K`.
- Use `Pick` to create a new type with the remaining keys.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your solution works for various object types and key omission scenarios.
- Test your `MyOmit` type with different object types to verify its correctness.

### Example Test Cases

```typescript
type Original = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

type Omitted = MyOmit<Original, "age">; // Omitted should be { id: number; name: string; }
type OmittedMultiple = MyOmit<Original, "id" | "name">; // OmittedMultiple should be { age: number; }
type OmittedNone = MyOmit<Original, never>; // OmittedNone should be { id: number; name: string; age: number; }
```
