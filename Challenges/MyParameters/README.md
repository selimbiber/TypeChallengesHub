# My Parameters

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyParameters` type that extracts the parameter types of a given function type. This type should allow you to obtain the types of the arguments that a function accepts.

This challenge will help you deepen your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with function types and type inference. Good luck!

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyParameters`.
- [x] This type should take a function type and extract its parameter types.
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's conditional types.

### Hints

- You can use TypeScript's `infer` keyword within a conditional type to capture the parameter types of the function.
- Consider how to handle different function signatures, including those with varying numbers of parameters.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your solution works for various function types, including those with no parameters.
- Test your `MyParameters` type with different function signatures to verify its correctness.

### Example Test Cases

```ts
type Test1 = MyParameters<() => void>; // Test1 should be []
type Test2 = MyParameters<(x: number) => void>; // Test2 should be [number]
type Test3 = MyParameters<(a: string, b: boolean, c: number) => void>; // Test3 should be [string, boolean, number]
```
