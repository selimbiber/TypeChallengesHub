# My Partial

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyPartial` type that makes all properties of a given object type optional. This type should allow you to create a new type based on an existing type where all properties can be omitted.

This challenge will help you deepen your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with mapped types and utility types. Good luck!

### Example

```ts
type ExampleObject = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  isActive: boolean;
};

type Result = MyPartial<ExampleObject>; // Result should be { id?: number; name?: string; isActive?: boolean; }
```

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyPartial`.
- [x] This type should take an object type and make all of its properties optional.
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's mapped types.

### Hints

- You can use TypeScript's mapped types to iterate over the keys of the object type.
- Use the `?` operator to make each property optional.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your solution works for various object types, including those with nested properties.
- Test your `MyPartial` type with different object shapes to verify its correctness.

### Example Test Cases

```ts
type Test1 = MyPartial<{ a: number; b: string }>; // Test1 should be { a?: number; b?: string }
type Test2 = MyPartial<{ x: boolean; y: { z: string } }>; // Test2 should be { x?: boolean; y?: { z?: string } }
type Test3 = MyPartial<{}>; // Test3 should be {}
```
