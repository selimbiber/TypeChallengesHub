# My Pick

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyPick` type that allows you to select a subset of properties from a given object type. This type should enable you to create a new type based on an existing type, including only the specified keys.

This challenge will help you deepen your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with mapped types and utility types. Good luck!

### Example

```typescript
type ExampleObject = {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  isActive: boolean;
};

type Result = MyPick<ExampleObject, "id" | "name">; // Result should be { id: number; name: string; }
```

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyPick`.
- [x] This type should take an object type and a union of keys, and return a new type with only those keys.
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's mapped types.

### Hints

- You can use TypeScript's mapped types to iterate over the keys of the object type.
- Use the `extends` keyword to constrain the keys to those that exist in the object type.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your solution works for various object types, including those with nested properties.
- Test your `MyPick` type with different object shapes to verify its correctness.

### Example Test Cases

```typescript
type Test1 = MyPick<{ a: number; b: string; c: boolean }, "a" | "b">; // Test1 should be { a: number; b: string }
type Test2 = MyPick<{ x: boolean; y: { z: string; w: number } }, "x">; // Test2 should be { x: boolean }
type Test3 = MyPick<{}, "a">; // Test3 should be {}
```
