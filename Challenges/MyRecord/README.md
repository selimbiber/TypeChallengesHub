# MyRecord

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyRecord` type that constructs an object type with a specific key type and value type. This type allows you to define an object where the keys are of a specified type and the values are of another specified type.

This challenge will help you enhance your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with mapped types. Good luck!

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyRecord`.
- [x] This type should take two generic parameters: a key type `K` and a value type `T`.
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's mapped types.

### Hints

- Use TypeScript's mapped types to iterate over the keys and assign the value type to each key.
- Ensure that the key type `K` can be any valid key type in TypeScript (e.g., string, number, symbol).

### Additional Notes

- Test your `MyRecord` type with different key and value types to verify its correctness.
- Consider edge cases, such as using union types for keys.

### Example Test Cases

```typescript
type StringNumberRecord = MyRecord<string, number>;
// StringNumberRecord should be an object type where all keys are strings and all values are numbers.

type UserRecord = MyRecord<"name" | "age", string>;
// UserRecord should be an object type with 'name' and 'age' as keys, both having string values.

type BooleanRecord = MyRecord<number, boolean>;
// BooleanRecord should be an object type where all keys are numbers and all values are booleans.
```
