# My Return Type

## Description

In TypeScript, create a `MyReturnType` type that extracts the return type of a given function type. This type should allow you to obtain the type of the value that a function returns.

This challenge will help you deepen your understanding of TypeScript's type system, particularly in working with function types and type inference. Good luck!

### Example

```ts
type ExampleFunction = () => string;

type Result = MyReturnType<ExampleFunction>; // Result should be string
```

### Tasks

- [x] Create a type called `MyReturnType`.
- [x] This type should take a function type and e tract its return type.
- [x] Implement this functionality using TypeScript's conditional types.

### Hints

- You can use TypeScript's `infer` keyword within a conditional type to capture the return type of the function.
- Consider how to handle different function signatures, including those with parameters.

### Additional Notes

- Ensure that your solution works for various function types, including those that return `void`.
- Test your `MyReturnType` type with different function signatures to verify its correctness.

### Example Test Cases

```ts
type Test1 = MyReturnType<() => number>; // Test1 should be number
type Test2 = MyReturnType<() => void>; // Test2 should be void
type Test3 = MyReturnType<() => { name: string }>; // Test3 should be { name: string }
```
